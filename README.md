# Comparing Baltimore, MD and Hartford CT's Household Income

## Background

As Hopkins students, we are well aware of the income inequality that plagued this city, but also income inequality in America overall. In this project, I want to explore how this problem manifests in Baltimore and Hartford, CT, where I previously went to school. [summary of findings here, 1 graph here]
